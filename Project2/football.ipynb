This dataset contains data from games from 2014-2020 and includes many different game statistics such as each team's rating, the match excitement, team posession percentages, shots on goal, etc. To get this dataset into a pandas dataframe, we first had to download the dataset from kaggle. After this, the data was downloaded into our local environment in the form of a .zip file with several different files within it. We then exported all of the individual .csv files from the original .zip file and loaded the combined .csv into our original dataframe."

Despite this, there are also several features that currently contain categorical data the obvious ones being the league and home/away team names. In addition, the final score and halftime score are also currently listed as strings and could be interpretted as categorical data or numerical data depending on the context. The string representation of the halftime and final scores are caused because the feature contains both the away and home team's goal total seperated by a hyphen. It may be beneficial to divide this feature into two features (home score and away score), but I believe that the total score representation also has merit because it shows the entire picture indicating the closeness of the game."
