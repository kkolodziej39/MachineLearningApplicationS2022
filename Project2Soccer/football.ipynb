This dataset contains data from games from 2014-2020 and includes many different game statistics such as each team's rating, the match excitement, team posession percentages, shots on goal, etc. To get this dataset into a pandas dataframe, we first had to download the dataset from kaggle. After this, the data was downloaded into our local environment in the form of a .zip file with several different files within it. We then exported all of the individual .csv files from the original .zip file and loaded the combined .csv into our original dataframe."

Despite this, there are also several features that currently contain categorical data the obvious ones being the league and home/away team names. In addition, the final score and halftime score are also currently listed as strings and could be interpretted as categorical data or numerical data depending on the context. The string representation of the halftime and final scores are caused because the feature contains both the away and home team's goal total seperated by a hyphen. It may be beneficial to divide this feature into two features (home score and away score), but I believe that the total score representation also has merit because it shows the entire picture indicating the closeness of the game."

In the code sections following the isnull() function, I was able to impute the remaining values in both the %LoseR and %DrawR columns using the data on matches, loses, and draws in each respective row. This will help enhance the completeness of our final dataset and make our final model more accurate. The remaining missing values were not able to be simply imputed because there was no data on fouls or missed shots within each row."

    "The above correlation heatmap finds the correlation between numerous different individual match statistics and the overall excitement rating. In creating this correlation map, we used all of the home team statistics because most of the fans at any given game will likely be favoring the home team and we believed that the home team statistics would be an overall better predictor of match excitement. Unsurprisingly, the statistics with the biggest positive correlation with match excitement was total shots with both clearances and total throw-ins exhibiting a slight negative correlation with match excitement. Another correlation that logically makes sense was that total corners was heavily correlated with total shots because most corners are generated through shots that the goalie blocks out of bounds."

This makes sense as intuitively I would assume that goals and shots would create more of a difference in win percentage than other things such as yellow cards, red cards, or total fouls. I did find it interesting; however, that yellow cards, red cards, and total fouls did have a decently sized negative correlation with total wins indicating that these statistics did negatively impact total wins despite fouls being a critical and sometimes intentional part of the game."

    "The output of the code above is a barchart representing the different average match excitment levels amongst the top 5 soccer leagues in the world. The line at the top of each bar serves to present the level of uncertainty around each estimation. As you can see, Ligue 1 (the French soccer league) appears to have the lowest average match excitement amongst the top 5 leagues. This isn't surprising as the French league is generally considered to be the least competitive and generally worst league amongst the top 5. However, what is surprising is that the English Premier League (EPL) which is considered to be the most competive league in the top 5 has a lower average excitement than both the Bundesliga (German soccer league) and Serie A (Italian soccer league) which are both generally considered to be less competitive. Overall, all of the averages are very similar meaning we can't take too much from these results; however, I do still think that comparing the leagues in this way is interesting. Additionally, I would like to know more about how the match excitement statistic was created and hopefully this can give us more insight into why we are seeing the differences amongst each league that are displayed above.\n",
